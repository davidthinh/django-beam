# django-beam
django-beam provides you with a set of views, templates and integrations for the most common CRUD
applications. 

The goal is having the functionality provided by django's own admin, but in a way that integrates
with your other frontend code. 

## Features
- CRUD operations based on class based views
- Default templates with multiple themes (bootstrap 4, ...)
- Extensions for common use cases, e.g. export as csv, ...
- Support for related models (autocompletion, linking, ...)
- Familiar interfaces

# Example
```
# models.py
class Person(models.Model):
    name = models.TextField()
    email = models.EmailField()

    groups = models.ManyToManyField(Group)


class Group(models.Model):
    name = models.TextField()


# views.py
class PersonViewSet(beam.ViewSet):
    fields = ('name', 'groups', )


class GroupViewSet(beam.ViewSet):
    fields = ('name', )


# urls.py
urlpatterns += [
    include('person/', PersonViewSet.get_urls()),
    include('group/', GroupViewSet.get_urls()),
]
```
