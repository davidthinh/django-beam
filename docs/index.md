Welcome to django-beam's documentation!
=======================================

django-beam provides you with a set of views, templates and integrations for the most common CRUD
applications. 

The goal is having the functionality provided by django's own admin, but in a way that integrates
with your other frontend code. 



For now we do not have any documentation besides the README.md
